# Introduction to Computer Science Using Ruby

The purpose of this book is to provide a well-constructed and logical path for learning computer science fundamentals. It uses the Ruby programming language for instruction, examples, and exercises.

From the [Ruby language website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),

> Ruby is... A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

I believe that Ruby is an attractive language choice for both beginning and expert programmers.
