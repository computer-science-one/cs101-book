# Introduction to Computer Science Using Ruby

The purpose of this book is to provide a well-constructed, logical path for learning computer science fundamentals. It uses the Ruby programming language for instruction, examples, and exercises.

From the [Ruby language website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),

> Ruby is... A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Ruby is an attractive language choice for both beginning and expert programmers. Some of the features which make it a good introductory language are:

### Non-significant whitespace

Some programming languages require a precise amount of whitespace at the beginning of a line (of code). This is a rather unforgiving environment for beginning programmers. Ruby does not suffer from the ailment that is significant whitespace.

### No semicolons

Several popular programming languages require the termination of lines of code with a semicolon (`;`). This is a tough habit to learn. Even experienced programmers forget semicolons!

### ~~No~~ few surprises

Ruby is a _consistent_ language. That is to say, it does what you expect (most of the time). By knowing some parts of the language, you can infer that other parts will work similarly. It is a rewarding experience: writing a new line of code for the first time and having it function correctly.
