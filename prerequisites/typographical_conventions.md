# Typographical Conventions

Ruby *source code* in this book will appear with a gray background, monospace font, and syntax coloring.

```ruby
puts "Hello"

class Foobar
  def baz_quux()
    Kernel.exit
  end
end
```

Terminal commands in this book will appear in a similar fashion. The dollar sign `$` character in the following figure merely represents your shell prompt. You will almost never begin a terminal command with a dollar sign. Let's say that you're trying to type following example command into your terminal. To do this, you'd begin by pressing the `r` key, because The letter `r` corresponds to the first letter of the `ruby` program).

```bash
$ ruby my_prog.rb
```
