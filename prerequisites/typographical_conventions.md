# Typographical Conventions

Ruby *source code* in this book will appear with a gray background, monospace font, and syntax coloring.

```ruby
puts "Hello"

class Foobar
  def baz_quux()
    Kernel.exit
  end
end
```

Terminal commands in this book will appear in a similar fashion.

```bash-session
$ ruby my_prog.rb

I'm the output!
```
