# Installing Ruby

To learn Ruby, you'll need access to a working Ruby interpreter.

## No-install method

Fortunately for you, you can try Ruby without installing anything on your computer!

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) is a website that gives you an interactive Ruby environment, right from the comfort of your own web browser. If you create an account and sign in, you can even save your "sessions" to your account.

## Install Ruby on your own computer

We highly recommend installing Ruby on your own computer. By doing this, you can save your work offline. Additionally, you won't need internet access to try out examples or complete your assignments!

Ruby runs on most operating systems. You can find a list of Ruby installation methods and tools directly on the official ["Installing Ruby"](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) page.

### Windows

[RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) will get you up and running if you're trying to use Ruby on the Windows operating system.
