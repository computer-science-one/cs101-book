# Preface

On more than a few occasions, I've been asked the following question:

> What books should I read to learn about computer science?

After a few seconds of thinking about this question, I realized that I never cared much about any of the books I read for college courses in computer science.

With that said, I hope this book can truly deliver on what I always wanted out of a computer science book (or any textbook, for that matter):

 1. The book should show signs of being well-thought-out.
 2. The book should be relatively short, to the extent that it is possible.
 3. The book should be fairly priced.
 
As you read this book, you should expect for the text to deliver on each of these promises.
